# JobSchedulingSimulation

Job Scheduling Simulation for Operating Systems which simulates a Process Control Block which is how the Operating System schedules jobs or tasks.

The program takes in input files and it will run the program based off of the input file, simulating CPU bursts and I/O bursts.

It uses a quantum time which means that each CPU burst and I/O burst only get a specified amount of time, then it will be preempted if it doesn't finish. 

The program reports statistics based on the input file to display the throughput of the jobs.
